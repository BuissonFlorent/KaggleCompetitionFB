# KaggleCompetitionFB
The scripts I used for my first Kaggle competition, on a dataset provided by Facebook

Final_script_v3.R: the main file, applying the C++ KNN algorithm to the dataset

multiknn3.cpp: the file with the C++ KNN algorithm, sourced through Rcpp

Function_repository.R: my previous attempts at creating a KNN algorithm fully in R, then in R with a C++ distance function, until I decided to go full C++
